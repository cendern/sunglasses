# sunglasses
A local html file for viewing a darker version of a website. Designed it for reading Overdrive ebooks at night to control brightness.
Android device brightness will only go so low, and I want it darker sometimes for reading at night.
This should be irrelevant once Android browsers have some way of adding user-controlled CSS.
